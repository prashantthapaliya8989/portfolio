            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p>
              Lack of appropriate solid waste management 
              system, unplanned and increasing urbanization and 
              increase in population has resulted in problems in 
              selection and management of proper solid waste 
              dumping sites in developing countries. Kathmandu valley, with an approximate population 
              of 2.54 million and population growth rate of 6.5% 
              per year, is one of the rapidly growing metropolitan 
              cities in South Asia (Timsina et al., 2020). Selection of 
              appropriate solid waste disposal sites should take 
              many considerations such as cultural, 
              environmental, social and spatial. For the analysis
              of such data, GIS technology can be useful as it
              allows users to store, process, analyze and handle 
              big data both spatial and non-spatial (Kumar et al., 
              2014).

            <h3>METHOD ADOPTED</h3>
            <p>
              For the evaluation, eight criteria were considered, among 
              them seven were factors (road network, water body 
              proximity, settlement proximity, slope, geology, 
              soil and landcover) and one was constraint (national 
              park). The factors were superimposed with AHP, which is 
              one of the widely used MCDM tool for processing 
              multiple important objectives and weighting the 
              criteria. Pair-wise comparison was carried out with nine-point 
              scale value which includes values 9, 8, 7, 6...., 
              1/7, 1/8, 1/9, which indicates 9 as extreme 
              preference, 7 as very strong preference, 5 as strong 
              preference and so on down to 1 which represents no 
              preference. The subjective judgment from AHP were checked via 
              consistency index. The consistency index (CI) was 
              calculated as:<br>
              CI = ( Œªmax - n ) / ( n - 1 ) --- (1)<br>
              &emsp;Where CI = Consitency Index<br>
              &emsp;Œªmax = maximum eigenvector of the matrix<br>
              &emsp;n = order of the matrix<br>
              The random index for this study was 1.32 for 7 order of 
              matrix and the computed Œªmax was 7.511, generating 
              the consistency index of 0.085. The matrix was 
              found to be consistent as the CR was 0.064.<br>
              The final step involved multiplying each factors by 
              weight and aggregating them to determine global 
              rating. In this regard, the rating scale of 1 to 4 was 
              considered that indicates 1 as unsuitable, 2 as least 
              suitable, 3 as suitable and 4 as highly suitable. The 
              suitability was evaluated by weighted summation of 
              factors which is expressed by given formula 
              (Hwang & Yoon, 1981).<br>
              S = Œ£ ùëäùëñ ùê∂ùëñ --- (2)<br>
              &emsp;Where, ùëäùëñ = relative importance of weight given to 
              the factors<br>
              &emsp;Cùëñ = criteria
              
            </p>
            <h3>RESULTS</h3>
            <img

            <p style="font-size: 15px"><i>Table: Area coverage of different factors</i></p>
            <p>
              Out of total study area, about 56% area falls under 
              unsuitable category in regards to water body 
              because there are rivers like Bagmati, Bishnumati, 
              Dhobi khola, Hanumante khola and Manohara 
              khola which dissect the Kathmandu valley. 21% of 
              the study area was found to be highly suitable for 
              water body proximity factor. Similarly, most of the 
              area in terms of road proximity and settlement 
              proximity was found to be unsuitable for waste 
              disposal because of the rapid increase in population 
              growth, the settlement and road infrastructure have 
              been tremendously established. Only 2% of the 
              total study area lies under suitable and highly
              suitable in settlement proximity for waste disposal. 
              Considering the slope factor, 34% of the total area 
              falls under highly suitable category as Kathmandu 
              valley is a valley itself which means there is low 
              area land between hills. There is very less area that 
              is highly suitable for waste disposal based on soil 
              type because most of the area of Kathmandu valley 
              has Silty Clay soil which is composed of 
              intermediate sized particles that makes it fertile 
              (KC & Dahal, 2020). Likewise, only 8% of the
              study area is highly suitable, followed by 12%, 24% 
              and 54% as suitable, least suitable and unsuitable 
              respectively. In the context of land cover, most of 
              the area was found to be suitable for the waste 
              disposal site.
            </p>
            

            <img
              src="../assets/img/portfolio_img/suitability_analysis/suitability_result2.png"
              class="img-fluid"
              alt=""
            />
            <p style="font-size: 15px"><i>Figure: Final Suitability Map</i></p>

            <p>
              As a result, about 48% of the total study area was 
              found to be restricted and unsuitable in which the 
              restricted area lies on the northern part, whereas 
              unsuitable area lies on the center and its 
              surrounding part of the valley. These regions are 
              mainly comprised of built-up areas with dense 
              population and industrial sites. Thus, such areas 
              should be excluded from the waste disposal site as 
              it may lead to serious environmental and health 
              problems. The least suitable site is about 51% of the 
              total area and suitable site is about 1%. This means 
              there are no highly suitable areas for waste disposal 
              in Kathmandu valley.

            </p>

            <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
            <p>
              Solid waste management 
              is one of the many problems that both developed 
              and developing countries face due to the growing 
              population. Kathmandu valley has a population 
              growth of 6.5% per annum. More population 
              produces more waste which needs to be managed 
              by authorities. The study showed that there is inadequate land for 
              the establishing waste disposal site in Kathmandu 
              valley. There should be adaptation of incisive 
              planning for the waste reduction policies. The 
              findings of this study could provide an important 
              statistic to the concerned authorities for planning, 
              maintenance and development of the waste disposal 
              sites. <br>
              The main limitation of this study is that all the data 
              used were obtained from secondary data sources. 
              Therefore, the used data may not be accurate and 
              relevant in the current context. It is recommended 
              that assessment of suitable sites for waste disposal 
              should be improved by incorporating more detailed, 
              robust and reliable data and methodology. 
              Furthermore, optimal site should be selected 
              considering further field investigation, geotechnical 
              and hydrological aspects, site lifespan and other 
              minuscule factors.
