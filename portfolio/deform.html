            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>
              Nepal is prone to earthquake as it lies on the boundary of Indian
              tectonic plate (moving north at about 45mm per year) and Eurasian
              plate. Indian plate is pushing and overriding Eurasian plate for
              long period of time and the plate get stuck at edges due to
              friction which causes stress that releases energy in the form of
              seismic wave (GeologyIn, 2015). The datum shift slightly due to
              various reasons such as slow continuous crustal movements, sudden
              movement due to earthquake and rapid movement after earthquake
              (aftershocks) that occur for number of days. So, the system does
              not remain fix for a long period of time. Hence, such shifts are
              shown by deformation model which mainly consists of two elements
              i.e. variations of earth’s movement due to long term crustal
              velocities and seismic deformation model due to earthquakes
              (Pearson C. , 2015).
            </p>
            <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
            <p>
              To prepare deformation model of central Nepal due to Gorkha
              Earthquake (April 25, 2015) and the aftershock (May 12, 2015).
            </p>
            <h2>STUDY AREA</h2>

            />
            <p style="font-size: 15px"><i>Figure: Study area</i></p>
            <h3>METHOD ADOPTED</h3>
            <p>
              In order to prepare the deformation model caused by earthquake,
              the active Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) were
              identified and downloaded during earthquake period. The raw data
              were post processed such that co-ordinates of each station were
              obtain in different days. The shift in Easting, Northing and
              Height in each station were computed. Furthermore, the Inverese
              Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation technique was used for
              obtaining shifts throughout the study area.
            </p>
            <h3>RESULTS</h3>

              class="img-fluid"

                >Figure: Graph of Change in Easting and Northing April 18 to May
                18 of KKN4</i

            <img
              src="../assets/img/portfolio_img/horizontal.png"
              class="img-fluid"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              The figure shows the horizontal deformation of earth surface in
              between april 25, 2015 and may 12, 2015. The earth surface moved
              towards the southern part in the central part and western part
              whereas the western part moved towards south east direction. The
              central part was affected the most due to gorkha earthquake and
              aftershocks.
            </p>

            <img
              src="../assets/img/portfolio_img/vertical.png"
              class="img-fluid"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              The figure shows the vertical deformation of earth surface in
              between April 25, 2015 and May 12, 2015. The northern part in
              central region was subsided whereas the central part was raised.
              CHLM was subsided by around half of meter and Kathmandu valley was
              raised by more than one meter.
            </p>

            <img
              src="../assets/img/portfolio_img/resultant.png"
              class="img-fluid"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              The above figure shows the final shift in CORS due to the
              earthquake which includes the Gorkha earthquake occurred in April
              25, 2015 which was followed by aftershock occurred in May 12,
              2015. The figure shows the combined overall change between that
              periods. During that period, the central region was affected the
              most and there was maximum shift in stations like CHLM, KKN4 and
              NAST. And, the surface in the central part moved towards the south
              direction.
            </p>
            <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
            <p>
              The 2015 earthquake of Nepal has caused more shift in Bagmati
              zone. However, there are unequal shifts in the affected regions
              due to unequal stress on Earth’s surface. Results of the project
              reveal that the Langtang valley has negatively shifted in vertical
              direction whereas the Kathmandu valley has positively shifted in
              vertical direction. The central region of the study area has
              shifted in south direction horizontally.
